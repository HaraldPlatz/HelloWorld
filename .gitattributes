# Automatically normalize line endings for all text-based files
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_end_of_line_conversion
#* text=auto
# This project needs all files in unix format, because during docker image create there are scripts to be running in a
# Unix OS and when these files are checked out with auto we got errors because these files are no accepted scripts on
# Unix
#* text eol=lf The problem with this line is that also binaries would be changed if they have 
# CRLF combination(s) 
* text=auto
# For the following file types, normalize line endings to LF on
# checkin and prevent conversion to CRLF when they are checked out
# (this is required in order to prevent newline related issues like,
# for example, after the build script is run)
